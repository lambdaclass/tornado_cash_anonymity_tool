# Anonymity Research Tools for TCash Users

This is the public repository for the Anonymity Research Tools for Tornado Cash users. The final objective of the projected research and proposed tools is to help protect the privacy of TCash users.

The development of tools to protect anonymity must be focused around the different kinds of reveals that privacy perpetrators exploit. For this, our team will research and identify many common reveals using data science and data engineering techniques in order to warn the Tornado Cash user.

This is really alpha code. We are still working on the final version of the heuristics and in an unified notebook.

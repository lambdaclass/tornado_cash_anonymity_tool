    "## Heuristic 3 - Transactions outside TCash\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The main goal of this heuristic is to link Ethereum accounts which interacted with TCash by inspecting Ethereum transactions outside it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done constructing two sets, one corresponding to the unique TCash deposit addresses ($S_{D}$) and one to the unique TCash withdraw addresses ($S_{W}$), to then make a query to reveal transactions between addresses of each set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Withdraw transactions are inspected one by one, searching for Ethereum transactions done between the withdraw address and any of the deposit addresses. When such a transaction is found, the withdraw transaction is linked with all the deposits of the deposit addresses that were done before the withdraw.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The query to the public BigQuery database was done like so,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INSERT `tornado_cash_transactions.transactions_between_withdraw_and_deposit_addresses` \n",
    "SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions`\n",
    "WHERE \n",
    "    (\n",
    "       (`from_address` IN ( SELECT `from_address` FROM `tornado_cash_transactions.deposit_addresses`))\n",
    "       AND \n",
    "       (`to_address` IN ( SELECT `withdraw_address` FROM `tornado_cash_transactions.withdraw_addresses`))\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    OR\n",
    "    (\n",
    "       (`from_address` IN (  SELECT `withdraw_address` FROM `tornado_cash_transactions.withdraw_addresses`))\n",
    "       AND \n",
    "       (`to_address` IN ( SELECT `from_address` FROM `tornado_cash_transactions.deposit_addresses`))\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting table has two columns, **from_address** and **to_address**, and each row corresponds to a transaction done between a TCash deposit address and a TCash withdraw address, outside TCash.\n",
    "From this table, we want to know which of the two addresses was the one that made the deposit and which one made the withdraw. In this way, we are able to link the corresponding deposit and withdraw transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider this entry from the resulting table,\n",
    "\n",
    "| from_address  | to_address  |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| address1      | address2    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that `address1` is an address that withdrawed in TCash and `address2` one that made a deposit. Then, we want to transform said entry to one with colums **deposit_address** and **withdraw_address** like so,\n",
    "\n",
    "| deposit_address | withdraw_address |\n",
    "|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| address2        | address1         |\n",
    "\n",
    "With this new table, it is straightforward to make de linking between TCash transactions. With it, we can create a mapping to know with what deposit addresses each withdraw address interacted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some definitions \n",
    "A problem raises when there are addresses that belong to the two sets of TCash addresses $S_{D}$ and $S_{W}$.\n",
    "Let us define an address of type `D` when it belongs to $S_{D}$ and not to $S_{W}$.\n",
    "Likewise, an address of type `W` is defined when it belongs to $S_{W}$ and not to $S_{D}$. \n",
    "Finally, when an address belongs to both sets, we classify it as a `DW` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the cases where we got outside TCash transactions of type `D -> W` (i.e., a transaction from a *D* type address to a *W* type address) or `W -> D` (i.e., a transaction from a *W* type address to a *D* type address), it is trivial to transform this entry to the new table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cases where we have transactions of type `DW -> W`, `DW -> D`, `W -> DW` and `D -> DW`, it is also straightforward to transform the corresponding entries. For example, consider again this particular entry of Ethereum transactions table,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| from_address  | to_address  |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| address1      | address2    |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now that `address1` is of type `DW` and `address2` of type `D`. Then, `address2` is trivially placed in the `deposit_address` column. By a process of elimination, then `address1` is set in `withdraw_address` column,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| deposit_address | withdraw_address |\n",
    "|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| address2        | address1         |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a transaction of type `DW -> DW`, it cannot be known which address deposited and which one made the withdraw, so the two combinations are considered. Considering again the same entry, the resulting table will be as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "| deposit_address | withdraw_address |\n",
    "|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| address1        | address2         |\n",
    "| address2        | address1         |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, deposits of `address1` are linked to withdraws of `address2` and deposits of `address2` are linked to withdraws of `address1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results data structure\n",
    "The results of this heuristic are returned as a dictionary where each element has a TCash withdraw transaction hash  as key and a list of the linked TCash deposit transaction hashes as a value. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    '0x4858': ['0x2fad', '0x750a']\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would mean that withdraw transaction `0x4858` is linked to `0x2fad` and `0x750a` deposit transactions."

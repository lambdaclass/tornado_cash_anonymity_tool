That information is encoded in the \"input\" field of the withdrawal transactions.\n",

    "If there is a deposit and a withdraw transaction with **unique** gas prices (e.g., 3.1415926 Gwei), then we consider the deposit and the withdraw transactions linked. The corresponding deposit transaction can be removed from any other withdraw transaction’s anonymity set."
